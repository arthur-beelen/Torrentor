# Torrentor
First C# project, to learn. Just a proof of concept in which APIs are used.

OMDb API is used to find the movie and get iunfo about the movie. Then YTS API is used to find the right torrents (YIFY). You can choose the quality and the program will automatically open the torrent with your torrent client.
